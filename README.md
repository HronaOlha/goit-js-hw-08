## Tasks

### 1. Task 1 SimpleLightbox library
   
Add the SimpleLightbox library as a project dependency using npm (the CDN link from your previous work is no longer needed).
Use your JavaScript code from the previous homework, but refactor it to take into account that the library was installed via npm (import/export syntax).

### 2. Task 2 Video player

The HTML contains an <iframe> with a video for the Vimeo player. Write a script that will save the current video playback time to local storage and, after reloading the page, continue playing the video from that time.

### 3. Task 3 Feedback form

HTML contains form markup. Write a script that will save field values to local storage when the user types something.
